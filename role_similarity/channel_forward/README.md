Channel Forward Definition:
A channel forward is a mobile attacker who opereates in half-spaces between full backs and centre backs. 
Instead of holding a central position, channel forwards tend to roam wider to find gaps.
Channel forwards attack space with their runs and destabilise the defensive structures.
Value comes from: Movement, strong pressing, contribution in transitions, combining goal threat with chance creation along with providing defensive support through a press.

Statistics:

        touches in box p90
    Channel forwards operate in the space between centre backs and full backs so we can use:

        ratio of central touches : wide touches
    Transition play:
        progressive carries p90
        carries into final third / box p90
    Chance creation:
        xAp90
        Key passes p90

        Pressures in (attacking) final third p90
        Defensive actions in (attacking) final third p90
